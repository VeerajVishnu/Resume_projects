### Project Plan
The primary objective of this project is to analyze hospital waitlist data in order to identify specialties that may require additional personnel and to detect any long-term trends in the waitlists. This analysis is essential for optimizing resource allocation and improving patient care within the hospital system.

### Dataset
The dataset comprises over 500,000 rows of detailed waitlist data from a large hospital chain. The data is divided into two primary categories: inpatient and outpatient data, each spanning over four years.

- **Inpatient Data**: Refers to patients who are admitted to the hospital and require an overnight stay. These cases often involve more severe conditions that need prolonged monitoring and treatment.
- **Outpatient Data**: Refers to patients who receive medical treatment without being admitted to the hospital. These cases typically involve less severe conditions or follow-up treatments that do not necessitate an overnight stay.

To facilitate comprehensive analysis, the inpatient and outpatient datasets were combined into a single table, allowing for an integrated view of all waitlist data across the four-year period. The richness of this dataset enables both longitudinal (long-term) insights and cross-sectional analysis, providing a robust foundation for understanding trends and patterns in hospital waitlists.
